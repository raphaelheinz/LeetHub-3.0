## What is LeetHub-3.0?

A cross-browser extension that automatically pushes your code to GitHub when you pass all tests on a <a href="http://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> problem. It's forked from <a href="https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/LeetHub-2.0">LeetHub-2.0</a> which is not compatible with Leetcode anymore since the latest updates.

### Browser Support
- âœ… **Chrome** (Manifest V3)
- âœ… **Firefox** (Manifest V2) 
- âœ… **Edge** (Chromium-based)
- âœ… **Opera** (Chromium-based)

> ðŸ“– **See [Cross-Browser Compatibility Guide](CROSS_BROWSER_GUIDE.md) for detailed installation and building instructions for each browser.**


## Why LeetHub?

There's no easy way of accessing your leetcode problems in one place! Moreover, pushing code manually to GitHub from Leetcode is very time consuming. So, why not just automate it entirely without spending a SINGLE additional second on it?

## Supported UI

LeetHub-3.0 works with two different Leetcode UIs. There are known issues when using the plugin with the "non-dynamic layout". Please use one of the following:

1. **old layout** or
2. new **"dynamic layout"**


## Manual synchronization

Your submission may not be successfully uploaded to GitHub if you update the text in the editor too fast. It is necessary to wait for 4 seconds (until the spinner stops) after submitting the solution before entering new characters, switching languages, or switching editors. During this period, your solution is being pushed to GitHub, and the website should maintain its layout without alteration. While this process is less than ideal, we have not found a better solution so far. Sorry for this inconvenience! If you find a fix, your PRs are welcome!

In the meantime, we have added a manual synchronization button next to notes icon. Please use the manual sync button only after you have successfully submitted your solution to Leetcode. Additionally, you can push previous submissions to GitHub by selecting the submission first and then click on the manual synchronization button.
